# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

If you want to contribute, just make a fork and create a pull request. Afterwards, I'll check the code and (most likely) merge it into the main project.

If you have any questions, you can create a post in the discussion tab. I will try my best to answer your question quickly.
