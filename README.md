# hacker-simulation

Program written in C++ to make code be printed rapidly in a terminal.

Useful as a terminal showcase, background for a film, or just because it looks nice.

Currently not finished nor polished.

### How to Use

Currently, this project is not quite finished.

To use it, download the files from the ```src``` directory (by either cloning the repository or downloading the files directly) then run ```g++ -std=c++[version 17 or higher] main.cpp``` then run the executable.

Currently, an easier way to run this program is planned for the future.
